## Origin

Work packages were originally defined in [agent-integration-plan.md](./agent-integration-plan.md). That document retains the historical context and detailed scope for each WP; this document is the authoritative source for current status.

## Pending Decisions (Not WPs)

These are decision items tracked separately from work packages:

- **Deployment Architecture** — Analysis complete, decision pending. See [decisions.md](./decisions.md#decision-deployment-architecture-managed-service--federation)
