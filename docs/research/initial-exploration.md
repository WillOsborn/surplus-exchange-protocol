# Initial Exploration - AI-Mediated Surplus Exchange

## Origin

This concept emerged from a Google Keep note exploring what happens when AI agents can handle commerce matching directly, potentially reducing the need for money as a medium of exchange.

**Core insight**: Money solved the matching friction in commerce. AI could solve matching directly, redirecting "excess value" toward social benefit rather than intermediary capture.

## Context: Google's Universal Commerce Protocol

Google announced the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) in January 2026, facilitating AI agent-based monetary shopping. Partners include Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target, Walmart.

**Key difference**: UCP optimises monetary exchange. SEP bypasses money entirely.

## Research Phase Findings

### Historical Systems Analysed

1. **WIR Bank** (Switzerland, 1934-present)
   - Most successful complementary currency
   - NOT pure mutual credit - loan-granting central bank
   - Countercyclical behaviour provides macroeconomic stability
   - Professional management by businessmen, not idealists

2. **Sardex** (Sardinia, 2009-present)
   - True mutual credit, zero-sum accounts
   - Active brokerage service (50+ employees)
   - Cyclic transaction motifs essential for health
   - Strong cultural fit

3. **LETS** (1983-present)
   - Most failed within 5-6 years
   - Exchange costs, social awkwardness, volunteer burnout
   - Critical mass threshold: 50+ members minimum

4. **Time Banks** (1973-present)
   - "All time equal" creates practical problems
   - Funding dependency causes collapse
   - Performance paradox in voluntary sector

5. **Corporate Barter** (ITEX, BizX)
   - Commercially viable, 40+ years
   - Professional trade directors
   - Recommend max 5-10% of gross sales

### Key Patterns

**Success factors**:
- Professional management
- Collateral/accountability
- Critical mass with diversity
- B2B focus over consumer
- Active brokerage, not directories
- Cultural fit

**Universal struggles**:
- Scaling beyond regional networks
- Valuation determination
- Balance management
- Tax treatment
- Volunteer burnout

## Design Insights Developed

### Subjective Value Ledgers

Each participant maintains own sense of balance based on own valuation:
- Track what you've given (your terms)
- Track what you've received (valued by your needs)
- Self-assess overall balance
- No external validation required

This eliminates valuation arguments and respects contextual value.

### The Surplus Frame

Focus on "otherwise wasted capacity" not "fair market value":
- Baseline: anything > nothing
- Reduces conflict over valuation
- Not competing with existing business
- Positions as useful tool, not ideological alternative

### Capability Translation

The MCP-like challenge: translate surplus into discoverable value:
```yaml
surplus_offering:
  type: service
  available_capacity: "20 hours"
  capability_mapping:
    - output: "pitch deck design"
      typical_effort: "4-8 hours"
    - output: "visual brand identity"
      typical_effort: "15-25 hours"
```

### Multi-Party Chains

AI advantage over human matching:
- Humans struggle beyond 2-3 parties
- AI can find: A→B→C→D→A loops
- Include transport, storage as surplus offerings
- Everyone benefits, no money, no debt

### The Automation Boundary

| Automated by Agents | Human Decisions |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Discovery | Proceed with match |
| Initial filtering | Scope confirmation |
| Feasibility checking | Satisfaction rating |
| Chain finding | Dispute resolution |

## Open Questions

### Bootstrapping
- Sector-specific seeding seems promising
- Who are anchor participants?
- What's the minimum viable composition?

### Divergent Assessments
- Less problematic than expected (subjective system)
- Post-exchange disappointment → ratings
- Systematic overvaluation → gentle feedback

### Taxation
- Surviving systems (WIR, ITEX) are tax-compliant
- May need notional values for corporate accounting
- Decouple internal accounting from network operation

### Physical Goods
- Location, transport, timing, condition
- Multi-party matching can include logistics
- Need structured description of physical constraints

## Strategic Framing

**Not**: "Alternative to capitalism" (stays small, dies)
**But**: "Useful business tool" (survives, scales)

Focus on:
- Capturing value that would otherwise leak
- Activating otherwise-wasted capacity
- Pragmatic benefit, not ideology

## Next Steps

1. Design capability description schema
2. Explore trust mechanisms without shared valuation
3. Prototype multi-party chain discovery
4. Map physical goods logistics requirements
5. Develop sector-specific seeding strategy
